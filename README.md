----------

This project is a collection of data files useful for working with BCP 47
language tags.

## Data Sets

The IANA Language Subtag Registry and other data sets are mirrored here to
provide stable versions for specific builds of projects and generated data
sets derived from these data files.

| File | Modified | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| [language-subtag-registry](language-subtag-registry) | 2019-04-03 | The [IANA Language Subtag Registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry). |
| [bcp47-extensions](bcp47-extensions) | 2018-03-24 | Private use BCP 47 extensions for describing accents, dialects, and language classifications. |

Additionally, the [relationships](relationships) directory contains data that
relates language codes together according to which language family they belong.
These files have line comments that start with the `#` character. The other
lines have the following format:

	TYPE:LANGUAGE:PARENT

where `TYPE` can be:

| `TYPE` | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `a`    | `PARENT` is the ancestor of `LANGUAGE`. |
| `d`    | `LANGUAGE` is a dialect of `PARENT`. |
| `f`    | `PARENT` is the language family of `LANGUAGE`. |
| `h`    | Hierarchical relationships of the language families. |
| `i`    | `LANGUAGE` is influenced by `PARENT`. |
